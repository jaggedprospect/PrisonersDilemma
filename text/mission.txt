During the Mission, an enemy recon team gains access to your communication
networks and intercepts your coordinates.

Within a matter of minutes, you and your Assistant are apprehended and
escorted to an unknown location for questioning. 

Your captors are willing to negotiate -- they will allow you to leave in
return for your cooperation.

However, lying may prove to be deadly for you or your Assistant!

It is time to make a choice:

1) I will CONFESS.
2) I will NOT CONFESS!
